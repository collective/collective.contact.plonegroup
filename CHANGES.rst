  [gbastien]

1.35 (2021-05-05)
-----------------

- Fixed `addOrModifyOrganizationGroups` called when an organization is modified,

  to only apply if we have a format like `My config (My suffix)` or it removed
  last letter.
  [gbastien]

  `@@display-group-users` is rendered short by default.
  [gbastien]

-----------------

- Combined v6 and v7 upgrade because it fails coming from v5
  [sgeulette]
- Corrected table class name.
  [sgeulette]

1.30 (2020-10-02)

- Added manage-own-groups-users view and functions/groups selection configuration.
  A user can manage the user assignments of his groups.
  [sgeulette]
- Avoid getting groups (only users) in `get_selected_org_suffix_users` function.
  [sgeulette]
- Avoid GroupNotFoundError in `get_selected_org_suffix_users` if suffix is limited to some organizations.
  [sgeulette]
- Added `BaseOrganizationServicesVocabulary._term_value` and
  `BaseOrganizationServicesVocabulary._term_token` to ease override
  of rendered term value and token.
  [gbastien]
- Make `SelectedOrganizationsElephantVocabulary` inherits from
  `OwnOrganizationServicesVocabulary` so methods `_term_value` and
  `_term_token` are available.
  [gbastien]
- In `@@display-group-users` instead displaying contained groups without
  contained members, display members of contained groups for normal users,
  display contained groups and contained members to Managers.

  in tests and profile is applied several times.
  [gbastien]

1.29.1 (2020-08-26)
-------------------

- Fix CSS for `@@display-group-users` view when current user not a Manager
  and so does not have link on prefixed icon (user/group).
  [gbastien]

1.29 (2020-08-18)
-----------------

- Added `PloneGroupUsersGroupsColumn`, a column that displays suffixed groups
  and users, to be called on dashboard displaying organizations.
  The groups and users are rendered by the `@@display-group-users` view
  that may also be used outside.
  By default, as groups and users may be very long to display, it is hidden
  in a collapsible `<div>` and displayed asynchronously.
  [gbastien]
- Added possibility to disable a `function` (`enabled=True` by default),
  this is useful to avoid deleting a `function` and re-adding it after,
  sometimes faultly.  Adapted `utils.get_all_suffixes(only_enabled=True)`
  to only get enabled functions.
  Added upgrade step to version `6` to manage new value `enabled=True`
  in `functions` stored in the `regsitry`.
  [gbastien]
- Remove item `UID` from link in `OrgaPrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn`
  as it is now displayed as additional information by default.
  [gbastien]

1.28 (2020-05-26)
-----------------

- In `utils.get_organizations`, do not use a `list comprehension` to turn
  result of `get_registry_organizations` into a list as it is already the case
  (was not the case a long time ago), `get_registry_organizations` returns a
  new list and values stored in the registry will not be changed anymore by
  default.
  [gbastien]

1.27 (2020-05-08)
-----------------

- Make the `OrgaPrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn` also work for `person` and `held_position`.
  [gbastien]

1.26 (2020-03-12)
-----------------

- As vocabulary `ram.cache` cachekey are generated based on
  module/class names, renamed vocabularies
  `collective.contact.plonegroup.selected_organization_services` to
  `collective.contact.plonegroup.browser.settings.SelectedOrganizationsElephantVocabulary`
  and `collective.contact.plonegroup.sorted_selected_organization_services` to
  `collective.contact.plonegroup.browser.settings.SortedSelectedOrganizationsElephantVocabulary`.
  Added tests showing that cache is correctly invalidated when selected organizations changed.
  [gbastien]

1.25 (2020-02-06)
-----------------

- Use `collective.contact.plonegroup.sorted_selected_organization_services`
  for `settings.IFunctionSchema.fct_orgs`
  (field for restricting a suffix to some organizations).
  [gbastien]
- In `validateSettings` invariant check if Plone group is empty using
  `getGroupMembers` that ignores `<not found>` users instead `getMemberIds`.
  [gbastien]

1.24 (2019-11-25)
-----------------

- Added group_as_str param in organizations_with_suffixes function.
  [sgeulette]

1.23 (2019-11-04)
-----------------

  the organization object in the REQUEST and avoid too much catalog queries.
  [gbastien]

1.22 (2019-09-26)
-----------------

- When passing `kept_org_uids` to `utils.get_organizations`,
  make sure order is preserved.
  [gbastien]

1.21 (2019-09-13)
-----------------

- Added `BaseOrganizationServicesVocabulary._term_title` to ease override of
  rendered term title.
  [gbastien]

1.20 (2019-09-12)
-----------------

- Added `collective.contact.plonegroup.every_organizations` vocabulary, to do
  this needed to write `BaseOrganizationServicesVocabulary` from which
  `OwnOrganizationServicesVocabulary` and `EveryOrganizationsVocabulary`
  inherits.
  [gbastien]
- Removed sorting on term title for
  `collective.contact.plonegroup.selected_organization_services`, terms are
  displayed following selection order in plonegroup organizations like before.
  Added new vocabulary sorted on term title and available as
  `collective.contact.plonegroup.sorted_selected_organization_services`.
  [gbastien]

1.19 (2019-08-23)
-----------------

- Optimized `OwnOrganizationServicesVocabulary.listSubOrganizations`, do the
  catalog query only if current organization contains something.
  [gbastien]

1.18 (2019-08-02)
-----------------

- In `OrgaPrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn`, set `showContentIcon` to True
  and enable `link-tooltip`.

  [sgeulette]

1.16 (2019-06-30)
-----------------

- Fixed error in `OrgaPrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn` when displaying
  organizations out of `PLONEGROUP_ORG`.
  [gbastien]
- Fixed `utils.get_organizations` when `caching=True` to store a new list of
  organizations in the cache instead returned value or value in cache may be
  modified if we modify returned value in a sub method...
  [gbastien]
- Use `get_registry_organizations/set_registry_organizations` and
  `get_registry_functions/set_registry_functions` as much as possible.
  [gbastien]

1.15 (2019-06-07)
-----------------

- Fixed problem, linked Plone groups title were not updated when suffix title
  changed and some `fct_orgs` were defined.
  [gbastien]
- In `settings.detectContactPlonegroupChange`, set `changes = True` only when
  relevant, due to wrong indentation, it was done systematically.
  [gbastien]

1.14 (2019-05-16)
-----------------

- Make `OrgaPrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn` work if displaying the
  `plonegroup-organization`, include link to plonegroup configuration panel in

  `utils.get_plone_group_id` from `org_uid` to `prefix` as it can be used in
  other cases.

  an organization uid from `fct_orgs` defined on a `function`.
  [gbastien]
- Removed dependency on `unittest2`.
  [gbastien]
- When calling `config.get_registry_organizations` and
  `config.get_registry_functions`, by default return a copy of stored data to
  avoid changing it.
  [gbastien]
- Added parameter `default=True` to `utils.get_own_organization`, in this case,
  default ids for `root directory` and `own organization` are used instead
  using a catalog query, it should be faster.
  [gbastien]

1.13 (2019-01-11)
-----------------

- Use unrestrictedSearchResults to check link integrity.
  [sgeulette]
- Added helpers config.get_registry_organizations,
  config.get_registry_functions, config.set_registry_organizations and
  config.set_registry_functions to easily get and set organizations/functions
  registry records.
  [gbastien]

- Added parameter `kept_org_uids` to `utils.get_organizations` to only keep
  organizations having defined UID.

  utils.get_own_organization/utils.get_own_organization_path.
  [gbastien]

  organization is created.

  never displayed.

  when no suborganizations instead displaying nothing.

  [gbastien]
- Overrided "@@suborganizations" view to display the entire hierarchy of contained
  organizations and sub-organizations and more informations in a table.
  [gbastien]
- When the plonegroup-organization is displayed in a tooltip, use original way
